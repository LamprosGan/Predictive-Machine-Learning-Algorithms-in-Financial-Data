This repository contains the code and experiments developed for my master's thesis: 
“Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms in Financial-Data”. 
The goal of this project is to explore and evaluate deep learning models for short-term stock price prediction using high-frequency Limit Order Book (LOB) data from stocks listed on the Athens Stock Exchange.
